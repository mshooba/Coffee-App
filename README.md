This project involves creating a dynamic, data-driven mobile website through an iterative process. The website will consist of three main pages: the landing page, the collection list, and the details page.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to create a mobile website that is dynamic and data-driven. The website should be created through an iterative process, using a Figma sketch to conceptualize and implement imagery, typography, color choice, and layout.

# Overview
The website will consist of the following pages:

Landing page – the page the user is shown when the app opens.
Collection list – the list of items, details, and customization from your collection data.
Details page – a details page for the selected items.
Requirements
To complete this project, the following requirements must be met:

Mockup – Create a Figma sketch that conceptualizes and implements imagery, typography, color choice, and layout.

Use a method to transfer the data of the clicked item – Use a method to transfer the data of the clicked item in menu.html to cart-details.html, such as passing the ID in the query string or by storing it in localStorage.
Display all of the details for the selected items – Display all of the details for the selected items from menu.html on the cart-details.html page.
Data must be dynamically loaded – Load data dynamically from the API/JSON file.
Navigation – Add navigation to the website:
Landing page navigates to the menu list.
Menu list navigates to the cart-details page.
A navigation item on the details page allows for navigating back to the collection list without hitting the browser back button.
Responsive Images – Dynamically resize the images according to the viewport size.
Graphic Design – Design the site for mobile phone-sized display, with appropriate color scheme, context-enhancing typeface, consistent imagery, and attention to design principles like contrast, repetition, alignment, proximity. Consider the principles of Material Design.

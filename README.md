# Beach Brew: Web App

This project involved creating a dynamic, data-driven mobile website through an iterative process. The website consists of three main pages: the landing page, the collection list, and the details page.

## Objective

The objective of this project was to create a mobile website that is dynamic and data-driven. The website was created through an iterative process, using a Figma sketch to conceptualize and implement imagery, typography, color choice, and layout.

## Overview

- Collection list – the list of items, details, and customization from your collection data.
- Details page – a details page for the selected items.
